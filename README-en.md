# typescript-rollup-starter

reference: https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter

A starter project that makes it very easy to create a TypeScript library.

# Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Spencer17x/typescript-rollup-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write down your library name when asked. that's all!
npm install
```

Start coding! package.json and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

# Build Environment

* prod: production environment(no console、no sourcemap)
* test: test environment
* dev: development environment
